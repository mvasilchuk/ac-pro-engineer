**AC Pro Engineer** is a standalone telemetry and race engineer tool designed for pure performance and utility. Unlike
heavy Electron-based overlays, this tool runs in a **Terminal User Interface (TUI)** using Rust for maximum speed and
zero lag.

It provides real-time analysis, live engineering advice, telemetry recording, and a **one-click Setup Cloud** ecosystem.

> ⭐ **Support the Project**
> If you find this tool useful, please give it a **Star on GitHub**! It helps visibility and motivates further
> development.

### 🛡️ SECURITY & TRANSPARENCY

**False Positive Warning:** Since this tool is written in Rust and performs high-precision memory reading to fetch
telemetry, some antivirus software (Windows Defender/Google) may flag it as a false positive (Trojan/Wacatac).

* **100% Open Source:** You don't need to trust the `.exe`. You can audit the code or compile it yourself from source.
* **Safe Behavior:** The tool **only reads** telemetry data. It does not modify game files or inject code.
* **Recommendation:** If flagged, please add the folder to your exclusions.

## 🚀 Why Use This?

* **Zero FPS Impact:** Utilizes **<0.1% CPU** and minimal RAM. Perfect for competitive racing and low-end PCs.
* **Hacker Aesthetics:** Professional TUI design. No bloat, just raw data.
* **Telemetry Persistence:** Save your best laps and compare them later.
* **Smart Updater:** Automatic updates with safe rollback capability.

## 📦 Installation

1. Download the latest `ac_pro_engineer.exe` from
   the [Releases page](https://github.com/Rgosh/ac-pro-engineer/releases).
2. Run the application.
3. Start Assetto Corsa and drive!

### 🛠️ Building from Source

If you prefer to build it yourself (requires Rust installed):

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Rgosh/ac-pro-engineer.git](https://github.com/Rgosh/ac-pro-engineer.git)
cd ac-pro-engineer

cargo build --release

cargo build --release
```

## ![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black)

The tool can show different information from the game by reading the game's shared memory. However, it is not
possible to directly access a Windows app's shared memory from a Linux app. So for that to work, we need
a small helper Windows tool [`shm-bridge.exe`](https://github.com/poljar/shm-bridge). This repository contains
a modified version of the bridge, which can be stopped by entering `exit` from the command line, instead of `Ctrl-C`.

Unlike the native Windows version, `ac_pro_engineer` on Linux **must be** started before the game (`acs.exe`) to create
the necessary shared memory links. It is not required to start the app before the `Content Manager`.

### Building for Linux

1. Build a Linux verison of `ac_pro_engineer`:
   ```shell
   cargo build --bin ac_pro_engineer --release
   ```
2. Build a *Windows* version of `shm-bridge.exe`
   ```shell
   cargo build --bin shm-bridge --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release
   ```
3. Optional. For simplicity, copy both binary files into the same directory:
   ```shell
   mkdir bin \
   && cp target/release/ac_pro_engineer ./bin \
   && cp target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/shm-bridge.exe ./bin
   ```

### Running on Linux

1. Put both `ac_pro_engineer` (Linux version) and `shm-bridge.exe` (Windows version) into the same folder.
2. Make sure [protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks) is installed.
3. Run `ac_pro_engineer`.
4. Run the game.
